the user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. Investment or Bond. If the user selects ‘investment’: ■ Ask the user to input: ● The amount of money that they are depositing. ● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%. ● The number of years they plan on investing for. ● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the interest rate.■ Print out the answer! ■ Try enter 20 years and 8 (%) and see what the difference is depending on the type of interest rate! If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: ■ Ask the user to input: ● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000 ● The interest rate. E.g. 7 ● The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. E.g. 120 ■ Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer.
